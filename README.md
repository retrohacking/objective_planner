# Objective Planner

Objective Planner is a command line tool that aims to help people to keep track of all the projects and the ideas, and it is useful if you cannot keep the focus on the same task for more than a day because you're always full of ideas and don't know where to begin.

## Functionalities

Objective Planner allows you to:
 - Insert a new objective
 - Set an objective as completed
 - Dismiss an objective (but without exaggerating! The dismiss are **limited** and are recharged **every month**)
 - List your objectives by their status

## Requirements

Objective Plannes is projected to work on Windows and Linux: it only requires Python3 to be executed.
**Before** running the tool it is suggested to run:
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Objective Planner is as guided as it can be. You will just need to run:
> python3 main.py

to start it.

When run for the first time it will ask how many simultaneous objectives should it allow you to add, and how many projects you could be able to abandon during a single month.
Then it will be the program to guide you across all the functionalities, so it shouldn't be difficoult to use.

## Some facts

- Objective Planner is a **completely offline** tool, so none of the plans or data you will insert will be published on the internet
- Objective Planner **does not use any encryption algorithm** so you can modify anytime the data you inserted at the beginning. <sub>It is considered cheating tho :sob: </sub>
- Objective planner is **open source**, so feel free to edit it, add functions, fork it, contribute to this project!
- <sub>I've created this tool because I am the first one who needs it, since I continuously have new ideas and never know where to start! :innocent: </sub>
